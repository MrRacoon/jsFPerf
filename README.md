Lots of talk about which immutable solution is faster and for what.

I made this repository because I was curious what the stats would be.


Installation
------------

```shell
npm i -g jsfperf
```

Usage
-----

By default, `jsfperf` will run all of the available tests with small sample
sizes.

if You want to alter the size of the samples, you can choose between `empty`, `singleton`, `deep`, `wide`.

If you only want to run a subset of the tests, you can append their names to the command.

```shell
# run all tests with small samples
jsfperf

# run the find benchmark with wide samples
jsfperf -w find

# run the find and assocPath benchmarks with empty samples
jsfperf --empty find assocPath

# run all tests with deep samples
jsfperf --deep
```
